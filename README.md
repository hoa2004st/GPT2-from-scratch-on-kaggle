# GPT2-from-scratch-on-kaggle
The starting source code forked from the source code of this tutorial video:
[Let's reproduce GPT-2 (124M) YouTube lecture](https://youtu.be/l8pRSuU81PU)

However, it is run local using a box with 8 A100 GPU, which is not available to most of college students.
This repo is an attempt to utilize 2 free T4 GPU offered by kaggle to run GPT2.
